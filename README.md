# Titanics Survival Prediction

In this notebook, I will go over how I build classificaiton models for predicting Titanic passenger survival.I chose this project because Titanics was the first movie I watched in a movie theater, and I've watched it for more than 3 times given the fact that I rarely re-watch movies :) Lets dive into the data and see what's affect passengers' survival! 


Background story: The skinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.


The dataset comes from Kaggle's Titanics competition. I divide the analysis into EDA, Data preprocessing (impute missing, encode categorical variables and creat new columns), and Model building and the final model reached 80% Accuracy.
